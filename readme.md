## Advent 2020

I'm using Python, because it's the best programming language. The end of 2020 is in sight, and this holiday season is a great opportunnity to relax, spend time with family, and reconnect with old friends. HOWEVER, I will not waste my time talking to anyone with solutions of an inferior time-complexity. Oh you used Haskell you must be super smart... I think I'll stick to python. Your code looks like spaghetti. Happy holidays everyone!
