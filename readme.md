## Advent 2020
I'm using Python, because it's the best programming language. Winter is a great season to spend time with family and to reconnect with old friends. HOWEVER, I will not waste my time talking to anyone with solutions of an inferior time-complexity. If you're not going to write good code then what's the point at all? I'm sick of all you computer science wannabes proud of your spaghetti looking code in Java or OCaml thinking you have what it takes to be a real programmer. Guess what, YOU SUCK! If you think you're hot stuff, think again. Take a look at your solutions... you and I both know they're not as crispy clean as my solutions. You could never envision high-quality code like mine, so I have some advice for you... QUIT!
