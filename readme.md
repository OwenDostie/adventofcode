## Advent 2020 Answer Key

I'm using Python, because it's the best programming language. As 2020 is coming to a close, this holiday season is a great opportunnity to relax, spend time with family, and reconnect with old friends. HOWEVER, I will not waste my time talking to anyone with solutions of an inferior time-complexity. I'm sick of all you computer science wannabes proud of your spaghetti looking code in Java or OCaml thinking you have what it takes to be a real programmer. Guess what, *you don't even know how a computer works.* If you think you're hot stuff, think again. Take a look at your solutions... you and I both know they're not as crispy clean as my solutions. You could never envision high-quality code like mine, so why are you even trying? Happy holidays everyone!

:)
